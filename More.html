                <h2>What makes Treaty One different?</h2>
                <p>Treaty One was the first treaty made between the Canadian government and First Nation people in 1871, covering what is now Manitoba. The treaty was created in the founding of Manitoba and the arrival of new people to inhabit the land.  Treaty One was different because it was the expectation for the treaties that followed after it, as in the following treaties they did not come across the same problem of confusion in what they were agreeing on, unlike Treaty One. With Treaty One the First Nations people and the government didn’t always agree on what the treaty meant. Some people didn’t fully understand the language or the way the treaty was explained. This made it harder to know exactly what each side was agreeing to, especially about land and resources. The next treaties, like Treaty Two and Three, were made with clearer rules as the government worked harder to make sure both sides fully understood what was being talked about.</p>

            <p class="source" style="text-align: left;">Treaty One is still affecting our lives as First Nations work to strengthen their rights and grow their economies through urban reserves and development projects. Urban reserves like the <a href="https://treaty1.ca/naawi-oodena/" target="_blank"> Kapyong Urban Reserve</a>, allow First Nations to build their own businesses helping create income opportunities for their community.  While businesses like the <a href="https://firstnationsgas.ca/band/long-plain-first-nation/" target="_blank"> Long Plain First Nation Gas Station</a> helps Treaty One communities grow. Projects like these allow for First Nations to have more control over their land and the money made goes into health care and education. Through these efforts, Treaty One continues to help First Nations get  more opportunities for success and independence.
