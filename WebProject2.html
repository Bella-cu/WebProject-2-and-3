            Welcome to our Treaty One website! Treaty One was the first treaty made in what is now Manitoba. It was an important agreement between the Canadian government and Indigenous Peoples. This website will help you learn about where it happened, the communities involved, and why it still matters today.</p>

            <p>Treaty One, also known as the Stone Fort Treaty, was signed in 1871. It was an agreement between the First Nations people and the Canadian government, as both sides wanted protection for their land and resources. The government promised to provide the First Nations people with food, money, and help with farming, while the First Nations agreed to share their land. 
                In return, the First Nations were also promised schools, medicine, and the ability to continue hunting and fishing on their land, as they had done for generations. Each family of five was promised 160 acres of land in Treaty One. This land was intended to help the First Nations people farm, build homes, and grow food to support their families.
